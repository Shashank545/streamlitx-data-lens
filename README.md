# LLM App with Streamlit

Welcome to the LLM App! This application allows you to interact with OpenAI's GPT models to analyze data and generate insights. You can choose between different GPT models and provide prompts to receive responses that help in understanding and visualizing your data.

## Features

- **Model Selection**: Choose between various GPT models (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`) to generate insights based on your data.
- **Data Visualization**: View a mock dataset in a tabular format and visualize it using interactive bar charts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive UI for entering prompts and displaying model responses.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: A fast way to build and share data apps.
- **OpenAI API**: For accessing GPT models.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## Requirements

To run this app, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `streamlit`
- `openai`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

You can install the required packages using pip:
